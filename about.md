Hi. I'm a self-taught programmer who works in the healthcare/biology field
and also involved in web-development side projects.
I don't get to do any interesting programming stuff in my day job, so I try to build
little hobby projects in my free time. I'm particularly interested in machine
learning, computational biology, statistics/data analysis, and mathematics but
I don't have any formal quantitative background, so I'm
attempting to teach myself the basics and will share my journey on this blog.
